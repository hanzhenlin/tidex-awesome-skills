## How to Use This Skill

### 1. Smart Recommendation Mode (Zero Friction: No IDs Required)
If you don't want to browse through indexes, **simply describe what you want to illustrate**! The Skill analyzes your theme's mood, domain, and context, then **automatically pairs the best-matching hand-drawn style with an optimal classic monochrome theme color** (including an aesthetic rationale):
- *Zero-parameter prompt*: `Generate a prompt for a healing illustration of a cat sunbathing on a windowsill, pick the style and theme color for me (can combine)`
  > 💡 *Recommended Pairing*: Style `#018 · Minimal Deadpan Dialogue Cartoon` + Color `C-26 · Persimmon Orange` (Rationale: warm, comforting, and relaxed atmosphere), outputting production-ready bilingual prompts immediately.
- *Completion*: If you specify only a style (e.g., `Style 276, Theme: Future of AI`), the Skill auto-recommends a harmonious color (e.g., `C-01 Klein Blue`). If you specify only a color, it auto-recommends a fitting style.

### 2. Precise Manual Selection Mode (Choose Specific IDs)
1. Open the [Style Visual Sheet (STYLES_en.md)](STYLES_en.md), [Layout Visual Sheet (LAYOUTS_en.md)](LAYOUTS_en.md), or [Classic Monochrome Colors Sheet (COLORS_en.md)](COLORS_en.md) to browse visual sheets and pick your desired numbers;
2. Note your chosen ID, such as style `041`, layout `SC-001`, or theme color `C-01`;
3. Send your prompt command to the Skill, for example:
   - **Style only**: `Style: 041, Theme: First milk tea of autumn`
   - **Layout + Style**: `Layout: SC-001, Style: 041, Theme: First milk tea of autumn`
   - **With Theme Color**: `Layout: SC-001, Style: 041, Color: C-01, Theme: First milk tea of autumn`
4. Receive clean, copyable bilingual prompts with precise style definitions, layout geometry, and unified color palette;
5. Copy and paste into Midjourney, DALL-E 3, Stable Diffusion, Flux, or any image generator to create your artwork.

### 3. AI Poster Design Mode (Structured Prompts, Native Integrated Layout)
Need to design festival campaign visuals, key art, or editorial social media posters? Simply tell the Skill your poster theme!
- **Prompt Command**: `请帮我出海报提示词， 主题：秋分` (or `Generate a poster prompt for me, Theme: Autumn Equinox`)
- **Intelligent Synergy**: The Skill analyzes the concept and pairs the best-matching hand-drawn style (e.g., `#268 · Contemporary Literati Ink Cartoon`) with classic theme colors (e.g., `Dominant: C-26 Persimmon Orange + Accent: C-03 Prussian Blue`). It outputs clean, structured prompts across **8 core design dimensions** (Theme, Scene, Audience, Density, Mood, Palette, Editorial Style, Hand-Drawn Style) with typography-composition integration guidelines.
- **Real Generation Showcase**: Passing the prompt directly to an image generation model (e.g., GPT Image 2/2.5) yields seamless native typographic layout and artistic metaphor fusion—large-character calligraphy title, poetic couplet inscriptions, seal stamps, balanced day-and-night imagery, and relaxed literati ink brushwork:

### 4. Pro Tips: The Universal Poster Mindset (Treat Infographics as High-Density Posters)
Feeling constrained by pre-canned infographic layouts? **Don't let rigid grids trap your imagination!**
The essence of an infographic is an information-dense visual poster. Simply tell the Skill your **time slots, core metrics, steps, and usage scenarios**; the model natively weaves timeline nodes, scenery illustrations, and typography into a cohesive editorial layout:
- **Travel Itineraries**: *Chiang Mai 5-Day Roaming (Day 1 Itinerary)* (Timed routes + landmarks + Northern Thai cuisine & tips)
- **Outdoor Gear Guides**: *Ultralight Mountain Camping Packing Guide* (3 core systems knolling lay flat + 8kg limit, workwear style)
- **Lifestyle Skills**: *Beginner Pour-Over Coffee Guide* (1:15 ratio + 3-stage pulse pouring timeline + flavor wheel)

💡 **[👉 Click to read the full Tutorials & Pro Tips Guide (TUTORIALS_en.md)](TUTORIALS_en.md)** (Covers the Universal Poster Mindset, Dynamic Recommendation, Triad Assembly, Dual-Mode Switching, and Multi-Model Tiering with complete copyable prompts).

### 5. Article Cover Design Mode (Summary Extraction, Audience Persona, Visual Metaphor Cover)
Finished an article and need a high-CTR, tasteful cover? Simply send your draft to the Skill!
- **Target Scenarios**: WeChat Official Account covers (recommended `2.35:1` or `21:9`), X/Twitter article covers (`5:2`), Xiaohongshu covers (`3:4`), etc.
- **Prompt Command**: `Please design a cover for this article: [paste article text or provide local file path d:\path\to\article.md]` (optionally specify platform or preferred style/color).
- **Automated Workflow**:
  1. **Core Summary Extraction**: Distills a ~200-word essence of key arguments, causal logic, and takeaways;
  2. **Audience Persona Inference**: Evaluates knowledge depth and motivation to construct target reader profile;
  3. **Style & Color Pairing**: Recommends the optimal match from 280 hand-drawn styles and 36 classic monochrome palettes (e.g., `#018 Minimal Deadpan Dialogue Cartoon` + `C-01 Klein Blue`);
  4. **Native Metaphor Directive**: Injects the proven editorial instruction—*"Design a visual metaphor first, then generate the image. Ensure the main title is bold and prominent, with few or no small text. Pick the rest of the design for me."* allowing the image model to compose clean, high-impact visuals natively;
  5. **Dual-Track Delivery Guidance**:
     - **Track A (Manual Generation)**: Copy the generated bilingual prompts into your favorite image tool;
     - **Track B (Fully Automated)**: Simply reply **"Auto generate cover"**, and the Skill will call the image generation tool to produce the cover visual directly.

### 6. Article Illustration Planner & Auto-Backfill Mode (Visual Planning, Cohesive Art, Markdown Assembly)
Walls of text cause reader fatigue and drop-offs; yet hunting for stock photos leads to disjointed art styles and frustrating formatting. This mode offers an end-to-end editorial pipeline: **"Editorial Point Selection → Unified Style & Color → Batch Generation → Automated Markdown Insertion"**:
- **Prompt Command**: `Please plan and generate illustrations for this article: [paste article text or provide local file path d:\path\to\article.md]`
- **Automated Workflow**:
  1. **Visual Editorial Judgment**: Rejects robotic paragraph-by-paragraph illustration. Understands narrative tension and conceptual complexity to pinpoint 2–5 high-value inflection points (thesis statement, abstract metaphor, structural diagram, climax, or concluding takeaway);
  2. **Unified Single-Style & Single-Color Harmony**: Locks the entire article to a single hand-drawn style (e.g., `#276 Contemporary Literati Ink`) and color palette (e.g., `C-01 Klein Blue`), formatted in an editorial standard `4:3` aspect ratio (with customizable whitespace: normal / moderate / generous);
  3. **Structured Plan & Prompts**: Specifies exact insertion anchor points, illustration purpose, image type (`editorial illustration`, `conceptual diagram`, `metaphorical illustration`, etc.), visual concept, and ready-to-use bilingual prompts;
  4. **Dual-Track Delivery Closed Loop**:
     - **Track A (Manual Generation & Backfill)**: Generate images with your preferred tool, then paste them or provide local paths; the Skill automatically inserts them after the correct anchor paragraphs in Markdown;
     - **Track B (Fully Automated Generation & Insertion)**: Simply say **"Auto generate and insert"**; the Skill sequentially generates all illustrations and triggers its built-in Python insertion engine to produce the completed, formatted Markdown document (e.g., `article_illustrated.md`).

### 7. Professional Photography Planning Mode (Couples/Weddings/Portraits/Families, 3 Candidate Plans & Instant 8-Grid Generation)
Say goodbye to cheap snapshot looks and generic AI portraiture! Whether planning couple sessions, wedding shoots, solo portraits, family portraits, ancient Hanfu, or travel snapshots, the system plans spacetime coordinates, styling, and cinematography to editorial studio standards:
- **Applicable Genres**: Couple photography, wedding shoots, solo portraits, family portraits, ancient Hanfu, New Chinese, vintage HK style, cosplay, travel snapshots, executive portraits, etc.
- **Prompt Command**:
  `Photography mode, please first propose 3 candidate directions for me to choose from, shoot type: couple`
  *(Or toggle to "Photography" mode in the web prompt assembler [tutorials.html](skills/handdraw-style-prompter/gallery/tutorials.html); theme is optional, AI will curate 3 diverse spacetimes if unstated)*
- **Automated Workflow & Core Highlights**:
  1. **Strict 3-Option Proposal First**: Proposes 3 candidate directions with dramatic geographical and worldview contrast (2 modern real-world landmarks + 1 time-travel / historical / future / fictional universe); never automatically decides for the user;
  2. **Per-Participant Styling & Makeup Decisions**: Details participant relationships, individual distinct wardrobes, and finalized Editorial hair & makeup (female subjects default to soft-focus studio retouch, preserving authentic skin texture and natural lighting);
  3. **Self-Contained Code Blocks with 8-Grid Keywords**: All 3 plans are fully encapsulated inside independent text code blocks (` ```text `) ending with the generation keyword `出8宫格图片。`;
  4. **Flexible Dual-Track Generation**:
     - **【One-Click Copy & Generate】**: Click the copy button on any code block to grab the full prompt, then paste into Midjourney, Flux, or any image generator;
     - **【Reply A / B / C for Instant Generation】**: Reply `A`, `B`, or `C` in chat, and the AI immediately generates the 8-grid sample image for that direction without waiting through tedious planning documents!

## Two Prompt Modes, Instant Switching

Any number and theme can seamlessly toggle between two modes without changing your style:

- **Pure-Image Mode (纯图模式)**: Let the theme dictate pure pictorial content without in-image text. Ideal for pure illustrations, wallpapers, book covers, and concept art.  
  *Example*: `Pure-image mode, Style: 041, Theme: First milk tea of autumn`
- **Graphic-Text Mode (图文模式)**: Preserves your copy text and guides the AI to design metaphors and integrate typography harmoniously into the visual composition. Ideal for quote posters, meme graphics, and social cards.  
  *Example*: `Graphic-text mode, Style: 267, Theme: There are many things you couldn't figure out back then. Don't worry, give it some time and you might just forget about them.`

Switch modes anytime by typing *"switch to pure-image mode"* or *"switch to graphic-text mode"*. Defaults to pure-image mode when unstated.

### Graphic-Text Mode Demonstration

The illustration below shows text integrated harmoniously with the visual composition (this is a conceptual demonstration and not tied to any single number):

![Graphic-Text Mode Demo: Duck with hand-drawn lettering](images/graphic-text-mode-demo.webp)

---

### Model Adaptation Mechanism

By default, the Skill crafts copyable prompts. When you explicitly request image generation, it optimizes the output based on verified model capabilities:

- **Explicitly Calibrated Models (e.g., `gpt-image-2`)**: Full activation hierarchy for all 324 styles: Style/Author Name → Positive Core Traits → Reference Image only when traits alone cannot reliably trigger the style, avoiding unnecessary image passing that might over-constrain the composition.
- **Third-Party & General Models (Midjourney, Flux, Stable Diffusion, Imagen, Gemini, etc.)**: Employs the rock-solid **Reference Image Fallback** strategy. The Skill provides a 1024x1024 4-grid standard reference image or file path, ensuring 100% faithful reproduction of linework, texture, and color palette without prompt drift.
- **Open for Community Benchmarks**: Capability definitions reside in `skills/handdraw-style-prompter/references/model_capabilities.json`. Pull requests for other model evaluations are warmly welcomed!

Style: 041, Theme: First milk tea of autumn
Style: 210, Theme: Little boy lighting firecrackers in the snow
Style: 193, Theme: Tang Dynasty Night Banquet
